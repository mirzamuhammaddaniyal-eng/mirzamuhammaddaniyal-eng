# MIRZA Muhammad Daniyal

**Python Backend Engineer** · FastAPI · TDD · PostgreSQL · Distributed Systems

I’m a backend engineer focused on building **clean, testable APIs** and **production-style services** in Python.  
Most of my recent work is around **FastAPI**, **async IO**, **background task processing**, and **LLM-powered services**.

---

## 🧠 What I’m good at

- Designing **REST APIs** and microservices with FastAPI
- Writing **clean, modular Python** with type hints and clear structure
- Using **async IO** for background jobs and high-throughput services
- Implementing **auth flows**, JWT-based sessions, and basic RBAC
- Integrating **LLM APIs** into backend systems in a safe, structured way
- Following **TDD** and writing meaningful unit tests with `pytest`

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, Pydantic  
- **APIs / Tools:** OpenAI SDK, HTTPX/Requests  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (learning), SQLite for demos  
- **Testing:** pytest  
- **Other:** Async IO, background tasks, JWT auth, Git/GitHub

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔐 [`auth-api-jwt`](https://github.com/mirzamuhammaddaniyal-eng/auth-api-jwt)
JWT-based authentication API built with FastAPI.  
- Supports **register**, **login**, and a protected **`/me`** endpoint.  
- Uses hashed passwords, **JWT tokens**, and a basic **health check** route.  
- Shows how to structure a small auth service for real applications.

### ⚙️ [`async-task-processor`](https://github.com/mirzamuhammaddaniyal-eng/async-task-processor)
Asynchronous task processing microservice with FastAPI.  
- Demonstrates **background task execution**, simulating queue/worker behavior.  
- Focus on **clean architecture**, separation of concerns, and production-ready API patterns.

---

### 🤖 [`llm-qa-service`](https://github.com/mirzamuhammaddaniyal-eng/llm-qa-service)
LLM-powered Question Answering API built with FastAPI.  
- Exposes a **`/qa`** endpoint for question answering and a **`/health`** endpoint.  
- Uses an LLM client (mocked for now) to generate concise answers from input text.  
- Structured as a **production-style backend service** that can be extended with real OpenAI keys.

---

### 🧩 [`fastapi-microservice-template`](https://github.com/mirzamuhammaddaniyal-eng/fastapi-microservice-template)
Template project for building new FastAPI microservices.  
- Layered structure: **routers → schemas → services**.  
- Includes example **unit tests** and a **health check** endpoint.  
- Designed as a starting point for future microservices.

---

## 📚 Currently learning

- Deeper **system design** for backend services  
- More advanced **PostgreSQL** & query optimization  
- **LLM function calling** and better prompt design for production systems
